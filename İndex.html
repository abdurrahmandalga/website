 <p> I am a dedicated, disciplined, hardworking, practical and punctual psychological counselor. I 
    am a confident, social, motivating, entrepreneurial and innovative person in communication. 
    I have become a person open to changes by improving myself with trainings in my field 
    throughout my school counseling profession. Not only in school life, but also for my career 
    development, I aimed to progress by constantly putting it on top of it. If I need to explain 
    myself briefly, I started my master's degree in Psychological Counseling and Guidance at 
    Bahçeşehir University in 2020 after my undergraduate degree. Last year I did Erasmus in 
    Berlin, Germany. This year I'm writing my thesis. <br>
    <br>I had the opportunity to counsel at all age levels, starting from primary school to high school. 
    Thus, by getting to know student groups in different developmental stages, I was able to 
    prepare more appropriate intervention programs for them. By aiming to solve students' 
    problems and support their development in social relations I did expressionist art studies, 
    group counseling and creative drama workshops. I did group work with students to guide 
    career work on the career sailing model. I applied cognitive intervention programs to 
    students with the CAS scale based on the PASS theory, not only for individual counseling but 
    also to support the development of children with special needs. I cooperated with 
    universities and enabled them to provide information to our high school students. By inviting 
    professional experts to our schools, students learned about law, medicine, engineering, 
    economics, etc. I contributed to their knowledge by experts in the fields. I gave seminars to 
    parents in many different areas such as exam systems, adolescence and privacy education, 
    learning styles, multiple intelligence, efficient study techniques, exam stress and coping with 
    it, positive parental attitudes.<br>
    <br>I made individual and group interviews to increase the academic performance of the 
    students. In cooperation with the coach and mentor teachers, I've worked on their 
    development of psychological, social, emotional and academic aspects. Opening up suitable 
    spaces for students to express themselves clearly for their development, I am a person who 
    thinks that it is necessary to focus on not only their weaknesses but also their strengths and 
    that students can improve themselves in this regard. By raising students' sense of 
    responsibility in social life, they set a good example for their environment. I have the 
    understanding that they can create and I am not afraid to make an effort for it.</p>
